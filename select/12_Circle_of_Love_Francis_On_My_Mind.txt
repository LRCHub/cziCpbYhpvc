Things may be fun
But never for me
You must have been blind
How else could this be

Things turning loose
I remember the way we were
Battered and bruised
I see the way that you talk to her

I see the way that you talk to her

I see the way that you talk
See the way that you talk to her

In this circle of love
I've been feeling like a fool
My heart goes numb
When she's around me and you

Things may be fun
But never for me
You must have been blind
How else could this be

Things turning loose
I remember the way we were
Battered and bruised
I see the way that you talk to her

See the way that you talk to her

In this circle of love
I've been feeling like a fool
My heart goes numb
When she's around me and you

She's around me and you

I've been feeling like a fool
My heart goes numb
When she's around me and you

In this circle of love
I've been feeling like a fool
My heart goes numb
When she's around me and you

She's around me and you
I've been feeling like a fool
Feeling like a fool
When she's around me and you
When she's around me and you
When she's around
