I am the prayer on the lips of my mother
I am the simple truth everyone knows
There in the shadow of every living soul
I'm just a child going home

Whoever you are
Wherever you go
Whatever you've lost
I want you to know whenever you give

All that you are
Nothing is lost
In the circle of love
In the circle of love

I am the love that was lost in cold war
I spent my youth chasing a dream
I am what's left of my good intentions
But I still want to believe

Whoever you are
Wherever you go
Whatever you've lost
I want you to know whenever you give

All that you are
Nothing is lost
In the circle of love
In the circle of love

Whoever you are
Wherever you go
Whatever you lost
I want you to know whenever you give

All that you are
Nothing is lost
In the circle of love
Nothing is lost

Whoever you are
Wherever you go
Whatever you've lost
I want you to know whenever you give

All that you are
Nothing is lost
In the circle of love
In the circle of love
