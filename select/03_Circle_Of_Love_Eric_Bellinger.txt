She ain't you typical lover
No idea where she came form
Maybe Mars

Lucky me here on earth living
Under the same sun

With the stars

She can do no wrong
But before you know
We'll be fighting
We'll be fussing
We'll be screaming
We'll be cussing
Back and forth
About discussions
That don't mean nothing
But that won't last for long
'Cause before you know
We'll be kissing
We'll be hugging
We'll be rubbing
We'll be touching
We'll be licking
We'll be sucking all night

We'll be fucking
It's the circle of a love

Circle of a love
It's the circle of a love
Circle of a love
It goes around and around and around and around
It goes around and around and around and around

It's the circle
Who said it would be easy
Tryin' to make it last for a lifetime

Love is hard
Anything that ain't worth working for

Really isn't even worth having at all

And at the end of the day I still say
She can do no wrong
But before you know

We'll be fighting
We'll be fussing
We'll be screaming
We'll be cussing
Back and forth
About discussions
That don't mean nothing
But that won't last for long
'Cause before you know
We'll be kissing
We'll be hugging
We'll be rubbing
We'll be touching

We'll be licking
We'll be sucking all night
We'll be fucking
It's the circle of a love
Circle of a love
It's the circle of a love

Circle of a love

It goes around and around and around and around
It goes around and around and around and around
It's the circle
First you love me
Then you hate me
Then you want me all over again
It's the same old circle

First you love me

Then you hate me
Then you want me all over again
It's the same old circle
She can do no wrong
But before you know
We'll be fighting
We'll be fussing
We'll be screaming

We'll be cussing
Back and forth
About discussions
That don't mean nothing
But that won't last for long
'Cause before you know
We'll be kissing
We'll be hugging
We'll be rubbing
We'll be touching

We'll be licking
We'll be sucking all night
We'll be fucking

It's the circle of a love
Circle of a love
It's the circle of a love
Circle of a love

It goes around and around and around and around
It's the circle
